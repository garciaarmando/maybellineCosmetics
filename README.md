# Maybelline Cosmetics Page

### Technologies used

- I used Figma to design the high fidelity wireframes
- For the layout I used pure HTML, trying to maintain an accessibility score > 90%
- I used pure CSS to provide the styles, considerating the responsive design with, at least, six screen sizes: 320px, 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px and 1440px.
- The app turns its interfaz into a dark mode automatically at 8 pm server hour.
