# Maybelline Cosmetics Page

### Technologies used

- I used Figma to design the high fidelity wireframes
- For the layout I used pure HTML, trying to maintain an accessibility score > 90%
- I used the Preprocessor SASS to provide the styles that compile to pure CSS, considerating the responsive design with, at least, four screen sizes: 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px.
- The app turns its interfaz into a dark mode automatically at 8 pm server hour.
