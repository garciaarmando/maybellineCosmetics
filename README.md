## Technologies used

- [Figma] - Here I made the high fidelity wireframes
- [HTML5] - To give structure to the content
- [SASS] - I wanted to be able to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more, besides to keep things organised and allow me to create style sheets faster.
- [JavaScript E6+] - To provide the logic to all the site and render dynamic content based on the API's response, I used modern declarations according to the last JavaScript releases like fetch with async-await.
- [Git] - To manage the different versions and changes.
- [GitHub] - The place where you're seeing this repo.
- [GitHub Pages] - To deploy the application
- [CORS Anywhere] - I faced a CORS policy problem when I was trying to get some data from the API, CORS Anywhere helps me to create a proxy before to fetch the data and avoid that problem.
- [Heroku] - To deploy CORS Anywhere
